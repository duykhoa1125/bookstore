**“Design a modern 2025-style online bookstore website with a clean neo-minimalist layout. Use large bold typography, generous whitespace, and soft-neon color accents. Include a hero section with a featured book, dynamic recommendation carousel, and a smart AI-powered book assistant.

Use adaptive mobile-first responsive design and a structured grid for book cards (12–16px radius, soft shadows, minimal borders). Apply soft brutalism elements, frosted-glass layers (Glassmorphism 2.0), and subtle micro-animations (hover glow, card lift, shimmer loading).

Integrate:
• Trending books section
• Genres category grid
• Personalized “For You” AI recommendations
• Search bar with natural-language input
• User reviews preview
• Minimalist header + sticky bottom nav for mobile
• Modern dark mode with neon accents

Use soft 3D illustrations or pseudo-3D book mockups. Background should be a light color-wash gradient or dark gradient for dark mode. Keep the tone premium, clean, futuristic, but warm and book-friendly.”**
